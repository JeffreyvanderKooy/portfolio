# My Portfolio Project

Welcome to my portfolio! This project began as a simple interactive command-line interface where users could fetch information about me, but quickly grew into something much more exciting. After experimenting with Googleâ€™s Gemini AI, I added dynamic, personalized experiences that change with each visit, along with features like chat persistence. I'm really proud of how this project turned out, especially since I had never worked with a Gemini model beforeâ€”this certainly wonâ€™t be the last time I dive into this technology! ðŸ˜„

**Live:** [Portfolio](https://jeffreyvdkooy.netlify.app/)

## Key Features

- **JeffBot**: A chatbot powered by Gemini AI that answers (most) questions about me. Enjoy a dynamic, personalized conversation experience with each visit!
- **Chat Persistence**: Pick up right where you left off! JeffBot remembers your past conversations, making each interaction more seamless.
- **Dynamic Data Fetching**: All data is pulled dynamically from the backend, allowing for easy scalability as I continue to add new projects and features.

## Technologies Used

- **Google Generative AI (Gemini Model)**: Powers the chatbot, generating unique responses every time you interact with JeffBot.
- **Bootstrap**: Ensures a responsive, clean, and modern UI that looks great on any device.
- **jQuery**: Simplifies DOM manipulation and enhances event handling for a smoother user experience.
- **Node.js**: Powers the backend of the site, serving as an API that handles data requests and responses.
- **MongoDB**: Stores chat history and other personal data, ensuring chat persistence across sessions.
